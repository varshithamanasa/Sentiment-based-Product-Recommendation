The "Sentiment-Driven Product Recommendations" project aims to enhance e-commerce product recommendations by analyzing user reviews for sentiment. We want to provide personalized and accurate recommendations that consider user emotions. To achieve this, we will collect and process a diverse dataset, employ sentiment analysis algorithms, and integrate them into recommendation systems. The project's impact lies in its potential to improve user satisfaction, increase sales, and demonstrate the practical application of sentiment analysis in e-commerce.
